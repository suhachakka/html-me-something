              <section class="wonder1">
                The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an 
                east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of china.

              <section class="wonder2">
               Petra is a famous archaeological site in Jordan's southwestern desert. Dating to around 300 B.C., it was the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom. Accessed via a narrow canyon called Al Siq, it contains tombs and temples carved into pink sandstone cliffs, earning its nickname, the "Rose City." Perhaps its most famous structure is 45m-high Al Khazneh, 
                a temple with an ornate, Greek-style facade, and known as The Treasury.

              <section class="wonder3">
                The Colosseum or Coliseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of travertine, tuff, and brick-faced concrete, it is the largest amphitheatre ever built. 
                The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum.

              <section class="wonder4" >
                  
                Chichen Itza is a complex of Mayan ruins on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. A massive step pyramid, known as El Castillo or Temple of Kukulcan, dominates the ancient city, which thrived from around 600 A.D. to the 1200s. Graphic stone carvings survive at structures like the ball court, Temple of the Warriors and the Wall of the Skulls. 
                Nightly sound-and-light shows illuminate the buildings' sophisticated geometry.

              <section class="wonder5">
                Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views. 
                Its exact former use remains a mystery.
